### chisel code
   I am lazy so I copied chisel-tutorials and build code on that.
.scala files are in example folder
shacompre.scala is the compression loop of sha 256
Lbi.scala is lattice based code I have so far.


`cd example


### To run test: 
` make shacompre.out

### To generate .v:
`  make shacompre.v 


Same thing for other .scala file.
